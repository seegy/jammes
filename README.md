Imagine you got your own smart home environment at home. Maybe there are some RaspberryPIs that pour your plants, control your heater, etc etc.
Because of security or other reasons, you don't want direct ssh access to your devices from everywhere. Maybe your devices send messages to Twitter about what they are doing (or not doing).
And now you are not home for a couple of days and one of your devices goes weird. It drowns you plant or simply turned off by itself. What now?

Jammes is a distributed, lightweight application for smart home devices (focus on RaspberryPI) to manage them remotely via Twitter Messages.
